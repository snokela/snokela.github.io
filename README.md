# Saana Nokela
Welcome to my personal portfolio!

This portfolio showcases my journey as an Information Technology student transitioning from a career in pharmacy. Currently, it primarily features school projects that highlight my skills, learning process, and professional growth. It also includes a personal project that I am gradually developing in my free time.
